Bayt Al-Kitab – A Digital Islamic Book Management System

BookShop is a full-stack web application that allows users to upload, manage, and read digital books online.
The platform supports two user roles: writers (who can submit books for admin approval) and admins (who review, approve, or delete books). 
All book covers and PDFs are securely stored in Cloudinary, with automatic file cleanup on deletion. 
The frontend is built with React and Tailwind CSS, providing a modern, responsive user experience, 
while the backend uses Node.js, Express, and MongoDB for robust data management and authentication.
